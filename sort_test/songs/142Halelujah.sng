1: (G)Now I've heard there was a (Em)secret chord 
                           
That (G) David played, and it(Em) pleased the Lord 
                                  
But (C)you don't really (D)care for music, (G)do you? (D)
    
It (G) goes like this the (C)fourth, the (D)fifth 
      
The (Em)minor fall, the(C) major lift 
                    
The (D)baffled king com(H"m)posing Halle(Em)lujah 

                
R: Halle(C)lujah, Halle(Em)lujah, Halle(C)lujah, Halle(G D G)lujah(D) 
 
2: Your faith was strong, but you needed prof 
You saw her bathing on the roof 
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you 
She tied you to a kitchen chair 
She broke your throne and she cut your hair 
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 
 
3: Maybe I have been here before 
I know this room, I've walked this floor 
I used to live alone before I knew you 
I've seen your flag on the marble arch 
Love is not a victory march 
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 
4: There was a time you'd let me know 
What's real and going on below 
But now you never show it to me, do you? 
And remember when I moved in you 
The holy dark was moving too 
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 
5: Maybe there's a God above 
And all I ever learned from love 
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you 
And it's not a cry you can hear at night 
It's not somebody who's seen the light 
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
