   wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door

2. Father McKenzie
   writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
   no one comes near
   look at him working
   darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
   what does he care?

3. Eleanor Rigby
   died in the church and was buried along with her name
   nobody came
   Father McKenzie
   wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
   no one was saved,
