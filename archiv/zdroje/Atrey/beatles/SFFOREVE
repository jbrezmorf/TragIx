2. No one I think is in my tree,
   I mean it must be high or low
   that is you can't you know tune in
   but it's all right that is I think it's not too bad.
R:
3. Always know sometimes think it's me
   but you know I know when it's a dream
   I think I know I mean 'yes' but it's all wrong
   that is I think I disagree.
