   something in the way she woos me.

R: I don't want to leave her now
!         Ami/G             D7 F D# G7/D
   you know I believe and how.
2. Somewhere in her smile she knows
   that I need no other lover
   something in her style that shows me.
R:

*: You're asking me will my love grow
!             D  G         A
   I don't know I don't know
!               C#mi/G#           F#mi F#mi/E
   you stick around now it may show
!             D   G         C
   I don't know, I don't know.
3. Something in the way she knows
   and all I have to do is think of her
   something in the things she shows me.
