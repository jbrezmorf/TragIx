1. I've just seen a face
   I can't forget the time or place
!                  F#mi
   where we just met she's just the girl for me
   and I want all the world to see
!          D        E        A
   we've met mm mm mm mm mm mm.
2. Had it been another day
   I might have looked the other way
   and I'd have never been aware
   but as it is I'll dream of her
   tonight da da da da da da.

R: Falling yes I am falling
!                  A       D        A
   and she keeps calling me back again.
3. I have never known the like of this
   I've been alone and I have missed
   things and kept out of sight
   but other girls were never quite
   like this mm mm mm mm mm mm.
