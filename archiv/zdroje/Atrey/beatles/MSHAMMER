2. Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
   teacher gets annoyed
   wishing to avoid an unpleasant
   sce-e-e-ene
   she tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
   so he waits behind
   writing 50 times "I must not be
   so-o-o-o."
   But when she turns her back on the boy
   he creeps up from behind.

3. P.C. Thirty-One said "We caught a dirty one"
   Maxwell stands alone
   painting testimonial pictures
   oh-oh-oh-oh
   Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
   say he must go free Maxwell must go free
   the judge does not agree and he tells them
   so-o-o-o
   but as the words are leaving his lips
   a noise comes from behind.
R: Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
   came down upon his head.
   Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
   made sure that he was dead.
