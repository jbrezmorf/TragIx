1. I get high when I see you go by      my oh my
!     C       Emi     Bb   F          G7sus G G+
   when you sigh my my inside just flies    butterflies
!     F           G             C      Ami
   why am I so shy when I'm beside you?
!              Bb              G7
R: It's only love and that is all
!                 C              Ami
   why should I feel the way I do
!              Bb              G7
   it's only love and that is all
!                F          G7
   but it's so hard loving you.
2. Is it right that you and I should fight ev'ry night
   just the sight of you makes night-time bright very bright
   haven't I the right to make it up girl?
!                  F          G7          C  Ami C Ami C Ami
R: + yes it's so hard loving you, loving you ...
