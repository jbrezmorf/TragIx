1. I'd like to be under the sea
!         A                         H  H7
   in an octopus's garden in the shade
!    E               C#mi
   he'd let us in knows where we've been
!          A                         H
   in his octopus's garden in the shade
!   C#mi
   I'd ask my friends to come and see
!   A             H
   an octopus's garden with me
!   E              C#mi
   I'd like to be under the sea
!         A          H              E(C#mi)
   in an octopus's garden in the shade.
2. We would be warm below the storm
   in our little hideaway beneath the waves
   resting our head on the sea bed
   in an octopus's garden near a cave
   we would sing and dance around
   because we know we can't be found
   I'd like to be under the sea
   in an octopus's garden in the shade.
3. We would shout and swim about
   the coral that lies beneath the waves
   lies beneath the ocean waves
   oh what joy for every girl and boy
   knowing they're happy and they're safe
   happy and they're safe
   we would be so happy you and me
   no one there to tell us what to do
   I'd like to be under the sea
   [: in an octopus' garden with you. :]
