1. Try to see it my    way
!                 D4sus           C            D
   do I have to keep on talking till I can go on
!                    D4sus D
   while you see it your way
!                     D4sus           C                D
   run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
!    G             D    G             A4sus A
   we can work it out we can work it out.
2. Think of what you're saying
   you can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
   think of what I'm saying
   we can work it out and get it straight or say good night
   we can work it out we can work it out.

   for fussing and fighting my friend
!   Hmi                        Hmi/A    Hmi/G F#sus
   I have always thought that it's a crime
!      F#     Hmi     Hmi/A  Hmi/G Hmi/F#
   so I will ask you once again.
3. Try to see it my way
   only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
   while you see it your way
   there's a chance that we may fall apart before too long
   we can work it out we can work it out.
