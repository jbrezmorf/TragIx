2. Well in a little while
   the Russians did attack
   'gainst Bonaparte and all his men
   they fought them and they drove them back
   the action being so hot
   right and left and front and rear
   a damn you all says Bonaparte
   I'll stay no longer here.

   made Bonaparte to run and leave his troops behind.
3. Away then went poor Bonaparte
   as fast as he could run
   the poor Frenchmen looked after him
   left horses men and guns
   his boxes and his matches
   ammunition wagons too
   he left them all behind him well
   what could poor Boney do?
R:
4. Away then went poor Bonaparte
   as fast as he could ride
   the poor Frenchmen looked after him
   saying oh it's very hard
   to think he'd lead us all up here
   and leave us to our fate
   you'd think he'd stop along with us
   and help us in our state.
R:
5. Here's eighty thousand men from 'em
   they've killed and they have taken
   likewise ten thousand horses
   and two hundred bits of cannon
   never more to Leon Paris
   or French Flanders they're advanced
   for if I do I may be sure
   they'll teach me how to dance.
R:
6. Now it's to conclude and thus
   to finish off me song
   old Boney's men and Russia wish
   they had a hold of him
   the cruellest death they'd put him to
   that ever a man befell
   oh damn you all says Bonaparte
   I'm clear of you all.
