1. As I was walking all alane
!                          C      Dmi
   I heard twa corbies makin' a mane
!               F                 C
   the tane intae the tither say oh
!      Dmi                   C        Dmi
   "Whaur sall we gang and dine the day oh
!                           C        Dmi
   whaur sall we gang and dine the day?"
2. "It's in ahint yon auld fail dyke
   I wot there lies a new slain knight
   naebody kens that he lies there oh
   but his hawk and his hound and his lady fair oh
   his hawk and his hound and his lady fair."
3. "His hound is to the hunting gane
   his hawk to fetch the wild-fowl hame
   his lady's ta'en anither mate oh
   so we may mak our dinner swate oh
   so we may mak our dinner swate."
4. "It's ye'll sit on his white hause-bane
   and I'll pike oot his bonny blue e'en
   wi' ae lock o' his gouden hair oh
   we'll theek oor nest when it grows bare oh
   we'll theek oor nest when it grows bare."
5. "There's mony a ane for him maks mane
   but nane sall ken whaur he is gane
   and o'er his banes when they lie bare oh
   the wind sall blaw for evermair oh
   the wind sall blaw for evermair."
