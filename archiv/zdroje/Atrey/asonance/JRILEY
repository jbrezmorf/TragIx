1. Fair young maid all in a garden
!                      D     Ami
   strange young man passerby
!               C                   G
   said "Fair maid will you marry me?"
!              Hmi            Ami
   this then sir was her reply.
2. "Oh no kind sir I cannot marry thee
   for I've a love who sails all on the seas
   he's been gone for seven years
   still no man shall marry me."
3. "What if he's in some battle slain
   or drownded in the deep salt sea
   what if he's found another love
   and he and his love both married be?"
4. "If he's in some battle slain
   I will die when the moon doth wane
   if he's drowned in the deep salt sea
   I'll be true to his memory."
5. "And if he's found another love
   and he and his love both married be
   I wish them health and happiness
   where they dwell across the sea."
6. He picked her up all in his arms
   and kisses gave her one two three
   saying "Weep no more my own true love
   I am your long lost John Riley."
