   my heart stood still me eyes grew blind

   for to see my bonnie lad leave me behind.

2. As I came in by yon lenten wend
   I spied another my love attend
   I bowed my head I cried achon
   the best of my good days are gone.
R:
3. And will I tell you the reason why
   because she's got more gold than I
   and I will tell you the reason true
   the sweeter taste of a love that's new.
R:
4. I leaned my back against an oak
   thinking it was a trusty tree
   but first it bent and then it broke
   and so has my love done unto me.
R:
5. And if you love me we'll never part
   and instead of gold you can have my heart
   you can have my heart with a right good will
   you're a bonnie laddie I love you still.
R:
