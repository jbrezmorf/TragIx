1. What a dream I had pressed in organdy
!     G                  F
   clothed in crinoline of smoky Burgundy
!    C               D
   softer than the rain
!   G                              C                 Ami
   I wandered empty streets down past the shop displays
!   G                         F
   I heard cathedral bells tripping down the alley ways
!   C           D
   as I walked on.
2. And when you ran to me your cheeks flushed with the night
   we walked on frosted fields of juniper and lamplight
   I held your hand
   and when I awoke and felt you warm and near
   I kissed your honey hair with my grateful tears
   oh I love you girl oh I love you.
