   she sure looks happy I sure am blue
!               A                   H7
   she was my baby till he stepped in

   goodbye to romance that might have been.

2. I'm through with romance I'm through with love
   I'm through with counting the stars above
   and here's the reason that I'm so free
   my loving baby is through with me.
