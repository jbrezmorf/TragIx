   Here is my song for the asking
!   Ami7                H
   ask me and I will play
!    H7  C           G            D7 G
   so sweetly I'll make you smile
!                    C       Emi
   this is my tune for the taking
!    Ami7                H
   take it don't turn away
!   H7         C      G       C  D7 G
   I've been waiting all my life
!     Emi                       Hmi H
   thinking it over I've been sad
!     G#dim                  Ami        D7
   thinking it over I'd be more than glad
!        G        G7 E C      Emi
   to change my ways for the asking
!   Ami7                H
   ask me and I will play
!   H7       C           G        C G D7 G
   all the love that I hold inside.
