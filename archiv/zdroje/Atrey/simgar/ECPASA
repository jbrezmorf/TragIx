1. I'd rather be a sparrow than a snail
!                                    Emi
   yes I would if I could I surely would
!                                  G
   I'd rather be a hammer than a nail
!                                         Emi
   yes I would if I only could I surely would.

R: Away I'd rather sail away
!            G
   like a swan that's here and gone

   a man gets tied up to the ground
!                 G                                   Emi

2. I'd rather be a forest than a street
   yes I would if I could I surely would
   I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet
   yes I would if I only could I surely would. C G C G Emi
