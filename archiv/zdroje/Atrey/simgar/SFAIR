1. Are you going to Scarborough Fair

   remember me to one who   lives there

   she once was a true love of mine.
2. Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
   on the side of a hill in the deep forest green
   parsley sage rosemary and thyme
   tracing a sparrow on snow-crested ground
   without no seams nor needlework
   blankets and bedclothes a child of the mountains
   then she'll be a true love of mine
   sleeps unaware of the clarion call.
3. Tell her to find me an acre of land
   on the side of a hill, a sprinkling of leaves
   parsley sage rosemary and thyme
   washed is the ground with so many tears
   between the salt water and the sea strand
   a soldier cleans and polishes a gun
   then she'll be a true love of mine.
4. Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather
   war bellows blazing in scarlet battalions
   parsley sage rosemary and thyme
   generals order their soldiers to kill
   and to gather it all in a bunch of heather
   and to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten
   then she'll be a true love of mine.
