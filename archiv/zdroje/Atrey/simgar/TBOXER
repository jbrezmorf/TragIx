1. I am just a poor boy though my story's seldom told
!           G
   I have squandered my resistance
!                                           C
   for a pocket full of mumbles such are promises
!                 Ami
   all lies and jests
!            G                 F
   still a man hears what he wants to hear
!                       C  G C
   and disregards the rest.
!           C                                               Ami
2. When I left my home and my family I was no more than a boy
!           G
   in the company of strangers
!           Dmi7                         C
   in the quiet of the railway station running scared
!           Ami         G               F
   laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
!                            C
   where the ragged people go
!            G             F      Emi Dmi    C
   looking for the places only they would know.

3. Asking only workman's wages I come looking for a job
!                G
   but I get no offers,
!           Dmi7                       C
   just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
!            Ami             Dmi7      C      F
   I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome
!                         C           G C
   I took some comfort there oo-la-la ...

4. Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
!          G
   going home
!              Dmi7     G7          G        C
   where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
!            Emi Ami    G  C
   leading me,  going home.
!            C                                            Ami
5. In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
!           G
   and he carries the reminders
!      G7
   of ev'ry glove that laid him down
!       C       Dmi7 G7  C
   or cut him till he cried out
!                          Ami
   in his anger and his shame
!          G             F
   "I am leaving, I am leaving"
!                            C
   but the fighter still remains.
