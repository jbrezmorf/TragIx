   sat on their park bench like bookends.
!      Emi7                         A
   a newspaper blown through the grass
!                 Hmi
   falls on the round toes
!           Dmaj7            G     D6   Gmaj7 Dmaj7
   on the high shoes of the old friends

   old friends winter companions

   the old  men   lost in their overcoats

   waiting for the sunset
!        Emi7          A7   F#mi7            Hmi
   the sounds of the city sifting through trees
!                A            G              D6
   settle like dust on the shoulders of the old friends
!    Emi7     A7       Dmaj7
   can you imagine us years from today
!     G        Gmi        D
   sharing a park bench quietly
!        Emi7       A7          Hmi
   how terribly strange to be seventy
!   Gmaj7 Dmaj7  Emi7    A7         Gmaj7 F#mi7
   old friends memory brushes the same   years
!    Emi7      A7         D6   Hmi Gmaj7 Dmaj7 Gmaj7 Dmaj7
   silently sharing the same fears ...
