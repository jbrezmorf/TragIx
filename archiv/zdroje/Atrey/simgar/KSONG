!   G            G4sus         G
1. I hear the drizzle on the way
!    Ami    Ami/G D/F#
   like a memory  it falls
!    G        Hmi     G  C
   soft and warm continuing
!    Ami    Ami/G  D        G
   tapping on my roof and walls.
2. And from the shelter of my mind
   through the window of my eyes
   I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets
!    Ami         D       C     G
   to England where my heart lies.
3. My mind's distracted and confused
   my thoughts are many miles away
   they lie with you in your sleep
   kiss you when you start the day.
4. And this song I was writing is left undone
   I don't know why I spend my time
   writing songs I can't believe
   with words that tear and strain to rhyme.
5. And so you see I have come to doubt
   all that I once held as true
   I stand alone without beliefs
   the only truth I know is you.
6. And as I watch the drops of rain
   weave their weary paths and die
   I know that I am like the rain
   there but for the grace of you go I.
