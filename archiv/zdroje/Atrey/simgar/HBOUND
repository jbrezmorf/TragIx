1. I'm sitting in the railway station
!          Emi                      Gmi6 A7
   got a ticket for my destination hm
!   Dmi
   on a tour of one-night stands
!       Bb
   my suitcase and guitar in hand
!       C
   and ev'ry stop is neatly planned
!                    G7       C
   for a poet and a one-man band.

R: Homeward Bound I wish I was Homeward Bound
!    C              Dmi     C  Bb F
   home where my thought's escaping
!    C             Dmi C    Bb F
   home where my music's playing
!    C             Dmi  C    Bb F    G7           C
   home where my love lies waiting silently for me.
2. Ev'ry day's an endless stream
   of cigarettes and magazines hm
   and each town looks the same to me
   the movies and the factories
   and ev'ry stranger's face I see
   reminds me that I long to be.
R:
3. Tonight I'll sing my songs again
   I'll play the game and pretend hm
   but all my words come back to me
   in shades of mediocrity
   like emptiness in harmony
   I need someone to comfort me.
