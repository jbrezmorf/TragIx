1. I can hear the soft breathing of the girl that I love
!           F           Gmi       C
   as she lies here beside me asleep with the night
!            F         Dmi        Bb          Ami
   and her hair in a fine mist floats on my pillow
!       F            Gmi        Bb C       F   Gmi
   reflecting the glow of the winter moonlight.
2. She is soft she is warm but my heart remains heavy
   and I watch as her breasts gently rise gently fall
   for I know with the first light of dawn I'll be leaving
   and tonight will be all I have left to recall.
3. Oh what have I done why have I done it
   I've comitted a crime I've broken the law
   for twenty-five dollars and pieces of silver
   I held up and robbed a hard liquor store.
4. My life seems unreal my crime an illusion
   a scene badly written in which I must play
   yet I know as I gaze at my young love beside me
   the morning is just a few hours away.
