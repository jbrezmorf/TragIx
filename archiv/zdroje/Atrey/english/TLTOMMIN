1. It's the last time too late for the learning
!    F       C    G       C
   made of sand made of sand
!                     F               C
   in the wink of an eye my soul is turning
!   F        C   G        C
   in your hand in your hand.
!            G                  F           C
R: Are you going away with no word of farewell
!               F         C           G
   will there be not a trace left behind
!      F                               C            Ami
   I couldn't love you better didn't mean to be unkind
!         C                G                C
   you know that was the last thing on my mind.
2. You have reason so plenty for going
   this I know this I know
   the winds have been steadily growing
   please don't go please don't go.
R:
3. As I lie in my bed in the morning
   without you without you
   every song in my breath starts a-forming
   without you without you.

R: + you know that was the last thing on my mind.
