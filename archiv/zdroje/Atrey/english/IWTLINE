1. I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
!             D                       G
   I keep my eyes wide open all the time
!              C                           G
   I keep the ends out for the ties that bind
!                   D               G
   because you're mine I walk the line.
2. I find it very very easy to be true
   I find myself alone when each day is true
   yes I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
   because you're mine I walk the line.
3. Just as sure as night is dark and day is light
   I keep you on my mind both day and night
   and happiness I've known proves that I'm right
   because you're mine I walk the line.
4. You've got a way to keep me on your side
   gave me cause for love that I can't hide
   for you I know I'd even tried to turn to tide
   because you're mine I walk the line.
!                        D               G
