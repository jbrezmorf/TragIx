1. Well I passed you one sunny day
!     C7
   flashed them big brown eyes my way
!     G                          D
   knew I want you see forever more
!         G
   you know that I don't do the round
!     C7
   swear my feet stuck to the ground
!   G               D          G
   oh I never did meet you before.
R:
2. Well I saw your lips I heard your voice
   lowdy I just had no choice
   horses couldn't make me stay away
   I dreamed about that moonlight night
   arms around you good-n-tight
   all I had to do was sit and say.
