1. Hear the lonesome whipperwill he sounds too blue to fly
!        C                  G                         D7        G
   the midnight train is whining low I'm so lonesome I could cry.
2. I've never seen a night so long when time goes crawling by
   the moon just went behind a cloud to hide its face and cry.
3. Did you ever see a robin weep when leaves begin to die
   that means he's lost the will to live I'm so lonesome I could cry.
4. The silence of a falling star lights up a purple sky
   and as I wonder where you are I'm so lonesome I could cry.
