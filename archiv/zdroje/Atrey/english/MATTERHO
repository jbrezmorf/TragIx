1. We started out from Bern one sunny August morn
!     C                                              G
   there was just the four of us against the Matterhorn
!             Emi                        G
   there was Albert the Australian and John the Irishman
!    C                                        G
   me and Bill from Britain mad dogs in the sun.

   men have tried and men have died to climb the Matterhorn
!         C            G
   that mighty Matterhorn.
2. Two miles up we lost John and the ration fell below
   Al and Bill were laying beneath an avalanche of snow
   now here I am all alone and I know I cannot stop
   two more yards in front of me before I reach the top.

3. Now here I am a-dying upon the Matterhorn
   not a grave for me to lie in not a thing to keep me warm
   the Queen would surely knight me if I could get back down
   but it's closer here to heaven than it is back to the ground.
