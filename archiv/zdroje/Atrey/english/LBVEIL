1. Ten years ago on a cold dark night
!     D                                  C         G
   there was someone killed 'neath the Town Hall light
   there were few at the scene but they all agreed
!             D                    C        G
   that the man who ran looked a lot like me.
2. The judge said: son what is your alibi
   if you were somewhere else then you don't have to die
   I spoke not a word though it meant my life
   for I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife.

R: She walks these hills in a long black veil
!        C          G              C           G
   she visits my grave while the night winds wail
!                                     D        G
   nobody knows nobody sees nobody knows but me.
3. The scaffold was high and eternity was near
   she stood in the crowd and she shed not a tear
   but sometimes at night when the cold wind moans
   in a long black veil she cries over my bones.
