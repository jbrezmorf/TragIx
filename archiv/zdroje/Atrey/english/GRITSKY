Name: Ghost Riders in the Sky

!      Ami
1. An old cowboy went ridin' out
!        C
   one dark and windy day
!       Ami
   at bolder ridge he rested
!          C
   as he went along his way
!        Ami
   when all at once a mighty herd
   of red eyed cows he saw
!     F
   driving through the ragged skies
!       Am
   and up a cloudy draw.
2. Their brands were still on fire
   and their hooves were made of steel
   their horns were black and shiny
   and their hot breath he could feel
   a bolt of fear cut through him
   as they thundered through the sky
   for he saw the riders coming hard
   and he heard their mournful cry.

3. As the riders loaped on by him
   he heard on call his name
   if you want to save your soul from hell
   a-riding on our range
   cowboy change your ways today
   or with us you will ride
   driving with the devil's herd
   across this moonlit sky.
4. Their face was drawn there eyes were blurred
   their shirts all soaked with sweat
   they're ridin' hard to catch that herd
   but theye 'aint caught 'em yet
   'cause they've all to ride forever
   on that range up in the sky
   oh the horses start to shire
   as they ride on through they cry.
