Name: Wayfaring Stranger

!               Emi
1. I'm just a poor wayfaring stranger
!                   Ami                 Emi
   a-travelling through this world of woe
   and there's no sickness nor toil nor danger
!                   Ami              Emi
   in that bright world to which I go.

R: I'm going there to meet my father
!               C               H7
   I'm going there no more to roam
!               Emi
   I'm just a-going over Jordan
!               Ami        Emi
   I'm just a-going over home.
2. I know dark clouds will gather 'round me
   I know my way is rath and steep
   but beautious fields lie just before me
   where soul's redeemed that vigils keep.
