   wherever you might look tonight you might see this wanted man.
2. I might be in Colorado or Georgia by the sea
   working for some man who may not know at all who I might be
   if you ever see me coming and if you know who I am
   don't you breathe it to nobody 'cause you know I'm on the lam.

   well I've had all that I wanted of a lot of things I had
   and a lot more than I needed of some things that turned out bad.
4. I got sidetracked in El Paso stopped to get myself a map
   went the wrong way into Juarez with Juanita on my lap

   wondering why the hell I'm wanted at some town halfway in between.
