2. Well I hope you come and see me in the movie
   then I know that you will plainly see
   the biggest fool that ever hit the big time

3. We'll make a scene about the man that's sad and lonely
   and beggin' down upon his bended knee
   I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsing
   'cause all I have to do is act naturally.
