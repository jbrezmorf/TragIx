1. Just like a blind man I wandered along

   now I have traded the wrong for the right

   praise the Lord I saw the light.

2. I was a fool to wander and stray
   the straight is the gate and narrow the way
   then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
   praise the Lord I saw the light.
