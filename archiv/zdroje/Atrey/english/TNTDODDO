1. Virgil Cain is my name and I served on the Danville train
!    G               Emi              C                   Emi
   till Stoneman's cavalry came and tore up the tracks again
!   C                 G
   in the winter of sixty-five
!            Emi         C
   we were hungry just barely alive
!               Emi     C
   I drove a train to Richmond, Nefelle
!             G        Emi         D
   it was a time I remember very well.

2. Back with my wife in Tennessee one day she said to me
   "Virgil quick come see there goes the Robert E. Lee"
   Now I don't mind choppin' wood
   and I don't care if the money's no good
   you take what you need and you leave the rest
   but they should never have taken the very best.

3. Like my father before me I'm a workin' man
   and like my brother above me I took a rebel stand
   he was eighteen proud and brave
   but a Yankee laid him in his grave
   I swear by the blood beneath my feet
   you can't raise a Cain back up when he's in defeat.
