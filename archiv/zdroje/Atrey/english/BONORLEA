Name: Battle Of New Orleans

!      G        C
1. In 1814 we took a little trip
!          D                             G
   along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississippi
!                                  C
   we took a little bacon and we took a little beans
!           D                               G
   and we met the bloody British near the town of New Orleans.
!        G
R1: We fired our guns and the British kept a-coming
!                                   D            G
    there wasn't as many as there was a while ago
    we fired once more and they began running
!                                 D           G
    down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
2. We looked down the river and saw the British come
   and there must have been a hundred of them beating on the drums
   they stepped so high and they made the bugles ring
   white we stood besides the cotton bates and we didn't say a thing.

3. Old Hickory said:"We can take them by surprise!"
   we didn't fire our muskets till we looked them in the eyes
   we held our fire till we saw the faces well
   then we opened up squirrel guns and really gave them hell.

R2: They ran to the briars and they ran to the brambles
    and they ran to the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
    they ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch them
    down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
4. We fired our cannon till the barrel metted down
   so we grabed an alligator and we fought another round
   we filled his head with cannon-balls and powdered his behind
   and when we touched the powder off the 'gator lost his mind.
