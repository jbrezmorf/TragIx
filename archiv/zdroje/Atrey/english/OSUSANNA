!        G                                   D          G

2. I had a dream the other night when everything was still
   I thought I saw Susanna dear a-comin' down the hill
   the red red rose was in her hand the tear was in her eye
   I said:"I'm comin' from the south Susanna don't you cry."

3. I soon will be in New Orleans and then I'll look all 'round
   and when I find Susanna I'll fall upon the ground
   but if I do not find her then I'll surely die
   and when I'm dead and buried Susanna don't you cry.
