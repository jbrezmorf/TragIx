1. Too much of nothin' can make a man feel ill at ease

   one man's temper might rise

   while the other man's temper might freeze

   in the days of long confessions we cannot mock a soul

2. Too much of nothin' can make a man abuse a king
   he can walk the streets and boast like most
   but he don't know a thing
   it's all been done before it's all been written in the book
   but when it's too much of nothin' nobody should look.

3. Too much of nothin' can turn a man into a liar
   it can cause some man to sleep on nails
   the other man to eat fire
   everybody's doin' somethin' I heard it in a dream
   but when it's too much of nothin' it just makes a fella mean.
