1. Brother Martin was walkin with me

   and every step I heard liberty

   tho he's fallin' come a million behind

2. Across the ocean the blood's running warm
   I hear it coming there's a thunderin' storm
   just like we lived it you know that it's true
   Nelson Mandela now we're walkin' with you!
R:
3. In our land not so long ago
   we lived the struggle and that's how we know
   slavery abolished comin' freedom's call
   keep on walking and apartheid will fall!
R:
4. Oh bread for the body there's got to be
   but a soul will die without liberty
   pray for the day when the struggle is past
   freedom for all free at last free at last!
R:
