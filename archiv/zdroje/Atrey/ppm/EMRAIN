!   G                     Hmi  Ami    D            G
1. In the early mornin' rain with a dollar in my hand
!                        Ami  D                       G
   and an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
!                        Ami D                        G
   I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so
!                         Hmi  Ami  D           G
   in the early mornin' rain with no place to go.
2. Out on runway number nine big seven-o-seven set to go
   but I'm out here on the grass where the pavement never grows
   well the liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
   there she goes my friend she's rollin' down at last.
3. Hear the mighty engine roar see the silver wing on high
   she's away and westward bound far above the clouds she'll fly
   where the mornin' rain don't fall and the sun always shines
   she'll be flyin' o'er my home in about three hours time.
4. This old airport's got me down it's no earthly good to me
   'cause I'm stuck here on the ground cold and drunk as I might be
   can't jump a jet plane like you can a freight train
   so I'd best be on my way in the early mornin' rain
!    G                    Ami D                     G
   so I'd best be on my way  in the early mornin' rain.
