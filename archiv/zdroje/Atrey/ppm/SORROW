Name: Sorrow
Author: Peter, Paul, Mary

!  Dmi      G               C
1. I am a man of constant sorrow
!               Ami           Dmi
   I've seen trouble all my day
!              G           C
   I'm going back to California
!               Ami           Dmi
   place where I was partly raised.
2. All through this world I'm bound to ramble
   through storm and wind through sleet and rain
   I'm bound to ride that northern railroad
   perhaps I'll take the very next train.
3. Your friends they say I am a stranger
   you'll never see my face no more
   there is just one promise that's given
   we'll sail on God's Golden Shore.
4.=1.
