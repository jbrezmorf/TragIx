1. In the shifting sands of your eternal name

R: Come back I am drunk and alone
!       D                           Ami
   I'm at the last ash from a cigarette
!   D                      C               G
   I can't explain or confess till comes down
!                D    C    Emi
   please come back back back.
2. I'd blind my own horse betray anything
   if only you'd nod when you pass on the stairs
   so look at me rider taking spring
   I'd blind my own horse betray anything.
R:

*: Believe me I'd blind my horse betray anything ...
