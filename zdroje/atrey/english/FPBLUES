1. I hear the train a comin' it's rollin' 'round the bent
!                                       G7
   and I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
!         C                                           G
   I'm stuck at Folsom prison and time keeps drogin' on
!              D                                     G
   but that train keeps rollin' on down to San Antone.
2. When I was just a baby my mama told me son
   always be a good boy don't ever play with gun
   but I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
   when I hear that whistle blows I hang my head and cry.
3. I bet there's rich folks eatin' from a fancy dinning car
   they're prob'ly drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
   well I know I had it comin' I know I can't be free
   but those people keep a movin' and that's what torlures me.
4. Well if they freed me from this prison if this railroad train was mine
   I bet I'd movin' over a little farther down the line
   far from Folsom prison that's where I want to stay
   and I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away.
