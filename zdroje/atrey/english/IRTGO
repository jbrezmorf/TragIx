1. In the darkness of night not a star was in sight
!                                   D
   on a highway that leads down below
!         G                          C         G
   then Jesus came in and saved my soul from sin
!                   D        G
   hallelujah I'm ready to go.

2. Sinners don't wait before it's too late
   he's a wonderful saviour you know
   well I fell on my knees when I answered my pleas
   hallelujah I'm ready to go.
