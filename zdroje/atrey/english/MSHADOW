1. The last time ever she saw him
!    H                 E          H
   carried away by a moonlight shadow

   he passed on worries and warning
!    H                 E          H
   carried away by a moonlight shadow

   lost in a riddle that Saturday night

   far away on the other side
!           E                         H
   he was caught in the middle of a desperate fight

   and she couldn't find how to push through.
2. The trees that whisper in the evening
   carried away by a moonlight shadow
   sing a song of sorrow and grieving
   carried away by a moonlight shadow
   all she saw was the silhouette of a gun
   far away on the other side
   he was shot six times by a man on the run
   and she couldn't find how to push through.

R: I stay I pray see you in heaven far away
!   E   H  E   H      E       A     H
   I stay I pray see you in heaven one day.
3. Four a.m. in the morning
   carried away by a moonlight shadow
   I watch your vision forming
   carried away by a moonlight shadow
   the stars move slowly in a silvery light
   far away on the other side
   will you come to talk to me this night
   but she couldn't find how to push through.
