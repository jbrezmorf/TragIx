Name: Dark Hollow

!               G     D         G
1. I'd rather be in some dark hollow
!                       C      G
   where the sun doth never shine
!                                C
   than to be here alone just knowin' that you're gone
!             G           D       G
   it would cause me to lose my mind.
2. So blow your whistle freight train
   blow it far on down the track
   I'm goin' away I'm leavin' today
   I'm goin' but I ain't comin' back.
3. I'd rather be in some dark hollow
   where the sun doth never shine
   than to be here in some big city
   in a small room with you on my mind.
