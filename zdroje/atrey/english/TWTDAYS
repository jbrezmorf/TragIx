Name: Those Were the Days
Author: Gene Raskin

!   Ami
1. Once upon a time there was a tavern
!                                       Dmi
   where we used to raise a glass or two
!                                     Ami
   remember how we laughed away the hours
!         H7                                      E
   and dreamed of all the great things we would do.

R: Those were the days my friend we thought they'd never end
!                  G                    C
   we'd sing and dance for ever and a day
!                  Dmi                           Ami
   we'd live the life we choose we'd fight and never loose
!               E                           Ami
   for we were young and sure to have our way
!                               Dm
   la la la la la la la la la la la la
!                   E                          Ami
   those were the days oh yes those were the days.
2. Then the busy years went rushing by us
   we lost our starty notions on the way
   if by chance I'd see you in the tavern
   we'd smiled at one another and we'd say:
R:
3. Just tonight I stood before the tavern
   nothing seemed the way it used to be
   in the glass I saw a strange reflection
   was that lonely woman really me?
R:
4. Through the door there came familiar laughter
   I saw your face and heard you call my name
   oh my friend we're older but no wiser
   for in our hearts the dream are still the same.
R:
