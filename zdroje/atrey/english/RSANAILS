Name: Rock Salt And Nails

!                        G      C                     G
1. On the banks of the river where the willows hang down
!                           Emi                       G
   and the wild birds all warble with a low moaning sound
!                Emi                         G
   down in the hollow where the waters run cold
!                         C                             G
   it was there I first listened to the lies that you told.
2. Now I lie on my bed and I see your sweet face
   the past I remember time cannot erase
   the letter you wrote me it was written in shame
   and I know that your conscience still echoes my name.
3. Now the night are so long Lord sorrow runs deep
   and nothing is worse than a night without sleep
   I will walk out alone and look at the sky
   too empty to sing too lonesome to cry.
4. If the ladies were blackbirds and the ladies wore thrushes
   I did lie there for hours in the chilly cold marshes
   if the ladies were squirrels with high bushy tails
   I did fill up my gun with rock salt and nails.
