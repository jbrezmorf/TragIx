2. If I was a small bird and had wings to fly
   I'd fly 'cross the salt sea to where my love does lie
   and with my fond wings I'd beat over his grave
   and kiss the pale lips that lie cold in the clay.
R:
3. Now the dove she laments for her mate as she flies
   oh where tell me where is my darling she cries
   and where in this wide world is there one to compare
   with my bonnie light horseman who was slain in the wars.
