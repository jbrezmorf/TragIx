2. Oh where is the boatman my bonnie will need
   oh where is the boatman oh bring him to me
   for to ferry me over the Tyne to my honey
   to carry him 'cross the run waters to me.

   and you for your troubles rewarded shall be
   if you ferry me over the Tyne to my honey
   and I will remember the boatman and thee.
