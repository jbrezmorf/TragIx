!         C             G            C          Ami
1. As I walked by the dockside one morning so fair
!       C              F          C            G
   to view the still waters and take the salt air
!      F            G                      C G C
   I heard an old fisherman singing this song
!                      F             C           G
   "won't you take me away boys my time is not long."
!           C        G             C     C7
R: Wrap me up in my oilskins and jumpers
!       F           C             G
   no more on the docks I'll be seen
!         F                         C
   just tell me old shipmates I'm taking a trip mates
!       G                                    C  G
   and I'll see you some day in Fiddler's Green.
2. Oh Fiddler's Green is a place I've heard tell
   where fishermen go if they don't go to hell
   where the weather is fair and the dolphins do play
   and the cold coast of Greenland is far far away.
R:
3. Where the sky's always blue and there's never a gale
   where the fish jump on board with a swish of their tails
   where you lie at your leisure there's nothing to do
   and the skipper's below making tea for the crew.
R:
4. When you get back in dock and the long trip is through
   there's pubs and there's clubs and there's lassies there too
   where the girls are all pretty and the beer is all free
   and there's bottles of rum hanging on every tree.
R:
5. Now I don't want a harp nor a halo not me
   just give me a breeze and the swift rolling sea
   and I'll play me old squeeze-box as we sail along
   with the wind in the rigging to sing me this song.
