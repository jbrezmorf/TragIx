1. When I've done the work of day
!          F        Dmi   Emi Ami
   and I rowed my boat away
!             F     G        Emi Ami
   down the waters of Loch Tay
!            D                 G
   when the evening light is falling
!           C               Emi  Ami
   then I look toward Ben Lawers
!             F       Dmi     Emi Ami
   where the after glories glow
!           F        G        Emi Ami
   and I dream of two bright eyes
!           Dmi   G       C
   with a merry mouth below
!             F         Dmi     Emi Ami
   she's my beauteous nighean ruadh
!             F       Dmi    Emi Ami
   she's my joy and sorrow too
!            F       Dmi      Emi Ami
   though I own she is not true
!             D              G
   oh but I cannot live without her
!           C                 Emi Ami
   for my heart's a boat in tow
!            F        Dmi       Emi Ami
   and I'd give the world to know
!           F        G      Emi Ami
   if she means to let me go
!         Dmi    G    C
   as I sing hori horo.
2. Nighean ruadh I do declare
   there's more beauty in your hair
   than all the tresses fair
   from Killin to Aberfeldy
   be they lint-white gold or brown
   be they blacker than the sloe
   they mean not as much to me
   as a melting flake of snow
   and her dance is like the gleam
   of the sunlight on the stream
   and the songs that we folk sing
   oh they're the songs she sings at milking
   but my heart is full of woe
   for last night she bade me go
   and the tears begin to flow
   as I sing hori horo.
