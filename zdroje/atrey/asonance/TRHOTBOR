   a sweeter place I never did know
!                Ami          G  C
   the rolling hills of the Border.
2. I've travelled far wandered wide
   I've seen the Hudson and the Clyde
   I parted by Loch Lomond side
   but I dearly love the Border.
3. Well do I remind the day
   with my lassies strode by the way
   but all these beauties fade away
   among the hills of the Border.
4. There's a certain place of mine
   bonnie lassies there you'll find
   men so sturdy yet so kind
   among the hills of the Border.
