Name: Down By the Sally Gardens

1. Down by the Sally Gardens my love and I did meet
!        G                F  C         Ami     G         C
   she passed the Sally Gardens with little snow-white feet
!        Ami G  Ami      G            F       G           C
   she bid me take love easy as the leaves grow on the tree
!               G          G  C         Ami       G     C
   but I being young and foolish with her would not agree.
2. In the field by the river my love and I did stand
   and on my leaning shoulder she laid her snow-white hand
   she bid me take life easy as the grass grows on the weirs
   but I was young and foolish and now I'm full of tears.
