Name: Come By the Hills

!       D           G            A          G         D
1. Oh come by the hills to the land where fancy is free
!                    G               D          G               A
   stand where the peat meats the sky and the lochs meats the sea
!              D           D/A           G         D           A
   where the rivers run clear and the bracken is gold in the sun
!            C          C          D          G          D
   and the cares of tomorrow can wait till this day is done.
2. Oh come by the hills to the land where life is a song
   sing where the birds fill the air with their joy all day long
   where the trees blow in time and caressing wind is in June
   and the cares of tomorrow can wait till this day is done.
3. Oh come by the hills to the land where legend remains
   where stories of old fill the heart, soon they yet come again
   when our past it is lost but our future is still to be one
   and the cares of tomorrow can wait till this day is done.
