   your gentle ways so want me

2. When you touch me with your fingers
   my cares and worries vanish
   like the morning dew before the rising sun
   when you rise tell me you love me
   and my soul is filled with wonder
   and my love for you will live when life is done.
R: Gentle Annie gentle Annie
   my love for you will live when life is done.
3. You're flower among the flowers
   you're bird's song in the morning
   you're the laughter of the children as they play
   you're my hope my joy and wisdom
   you're my reason just for being
   you're my treasure you're my very night and day.
R: Gentle Annie gentle Annie
   you're my treasure you're my very night and day.

   and the earth stop its turning
!                                                   A
   when the winds don't blow and stars refuse to shine

   when the moon has left the heavens
!            A             D
   and the seven seas are empty
!                            Emi   A      D
   I will still have gentle Annie on my mind.
