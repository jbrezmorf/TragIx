1. By a lonely prison wall I heard a young girl calling
!     D                 G          A
   "Michael they have taken you away
!             D                G          D                    A
   for you stole Trevalyan's corn so the young could see the morn
!                                          D
   now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay."

R: Low lie the fields of Athenry
!         D        Hmi                           A
   where once we watched the small free birds fly
!        D               G            D                  A
   our love was on the wing we had dreams and songs to sing
!                                             D
   it's so lonely 'round the fields of Athenry.
2. By a lonely prison wall I heard a young man calling
   "nothing matters Mary when you're free
   against the famine and the crown I rebelled they cut me down
   now you must raise our child with dignity."
R:
3. By a lonely harbour wall she watch the last star falling
   as the prison ship sailed out against the sky
   for she lived in hope and pray for her love in Botany Bay
   it's so lonely 'round the fields of Athenry.
