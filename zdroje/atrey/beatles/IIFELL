   If I fell in love with you would you promise to be true
!        C#            Bbmi
   and help me understand
!                D#mi                      D
   'cause I've been in love before and I found that love was more
!         Emi7         A
   than just holding hands
!         D    Emi F#mi  Fdim Emi7   A7
   if I give my  heart to    you I must be sure
!             D Emi F#mi  Fdim Emi7       A7                D Gmi A7
   from the very start that   you would love me more than her
!          D   Emi F#mi  Fdim Emi7        A7
   if I trust in  you   oh please don't run and hide
!         D   Emi  F#mi  Fdim Emi7        A7                 D9
   if I love you too    oh please don't hurt my pride like her
!                                   G
   [: 'cause I couldn't stand the pain
!          Gmi                    D               A7
      and I would be sad if our new love was in vain
!            D   Emi  F#mi Fdim Emi7     A7
      so I hope you see that   I would love to love you
!      D     Emi  F#mi Fdim  Emi7     A7                D9(D)
      and that she   will cry when she learns we are two :]
!         Gmi              D  Gmi D
   if I fell in love with you ...
