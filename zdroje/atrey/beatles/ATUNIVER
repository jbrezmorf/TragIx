1. Words are flying out like endless
!    F#mi
   rain into a paper cup
!          Emi7/A
   they slither while they pass they slip
!     A
   away across the universe.

*: Pools of sorrow waves of joy
!         F#mi
   are drifting through my open mind
!       Emi7/A        Gmi
   possessing and caressing me.

2. Images of broken light
   which dance before me like a million eyes
   that call me on and on
   across the universe.
3. Thoughts meander like a restless
   wind inside a letter box
   they tumble blindly as they make
   their way across the universe.
R:
*: Sounds of laughter shades on earth
   are ringing through my open views
   inciting and inviting me.
4. Limitless undying love
   which shines around me like a million eyes
   it calls me on and on
   across the universe.
