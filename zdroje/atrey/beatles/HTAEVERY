1. Here    making each day of the year

   changing my life with the wave of her hand

   nobody can deny that there's something there.
2. There running my hands through her hair
   both of us thinking how good it can be
   someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there.

   I know I need never care

   but to love her is to need her everywhere
!     Hmi         C           G  Ami7
   knowing that love is to share
!   Hmi         C            F#mi7      H7
   each one believing that love never dies
!    F#mi7       H7        Emi       Ami      Ami7 D7sus
   watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there.
