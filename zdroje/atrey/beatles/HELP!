1. When I was younger so much younger than today
!   Emi                       C      F    G
   I never needed anybody's help in any way
!                                    Hmi
   but now these days are gone I'm not so self assured
!    Emi                                 C      F       G
   now I find I've changed my mind I've opened up the doors.
!    Ami                               G
R: Help me if you can I'm feeling down
!          F                            F/E
   and I do appreciate you being 'round
!    D7
   help me get my feet back on the ground
!               G
   won't you please please help me?
2. And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
   my independence seems to vanish in the haze
   but every now and then I feel so insecure
   I know that I just need you like I've never done before.
