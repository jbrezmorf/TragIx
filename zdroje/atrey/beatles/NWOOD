1. I once had a girl or should I say she once had me
!                                         Hmi7 A    E
   she showed me her room isn't it good Norwegian wood
!       Emi                                          A
   she asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
!      Emi                                            F#mi H7
   so I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair.
2. I sat on a rug biding my time drinking her wine
   we talked until two and then she said:"It's time for bed"
   she told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
   I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath.

*: And when I awoke I was alone this bird had flown
!                                  Hmi7 A    E
   so I lit a fire isn't it good Norwegian wood?
