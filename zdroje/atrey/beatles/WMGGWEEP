1. I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
!     Ami        G          C   E7
   while my guitar gently weeps
!      Ami          Ami/G      Ami/F#        Fmaj7
   I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
!     Ami        G          C   E7
   still my guitar gently weeps.

R: I don't know why   nobody told you
!    Hmi                E7 D/F# E7
   how to unfold your love
!   A             C#mi F#mi        C#mi
   I don't know how  someone controlled you
!     Hmi                E7 D/F#
   they bought and sold you.
2. I look at the world and I notice it's turning
   while my guitar gently weeps
   with every mistake we must surely be learning
   still my guitar gently weeps.
R: I don't know how you were diverted
   you were perverted too
   I don't know how you were inverted
   no one alerted you.
3. I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
   while my guitar gently weeps
   I Iook at you all see the love there that's sleeping
   still my guitar gently weeps.
