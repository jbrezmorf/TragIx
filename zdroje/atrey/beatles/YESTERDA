1. Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away
!    Bb     C                       F
   now it looks as though they're here to stay
!   C/E Dmi  G7       Bb    F
   oh  I believe in yesterday.
2. Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be
   there's a shadow hanging over me
   oh yesterday came suddenly.

!   Emi A    Dmi C      Bb   Dmi   Gmi     C7     F
   I  said something wrong now I long for yesterday.
3. Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
   now I need a place to hide away
   oh I believe in yesterday.
