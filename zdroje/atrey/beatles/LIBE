   living in the world agree
   there will be an answer let it be
   for though they may be parted
   there is still a chance that they will see
   there will be an answer let it be.

3. And when the night is cloudy
   there is still a light that shines on me
   shine until the morrow let it be
   I wake up to the sound of music
   Mother Mary comes to me
   speaking words of wisdom let it be.
