1. If you let me take your heart I will prove to you

   we will never be apart if I'm part of you
!   C            G         C                G
   open up your eyes now tell me what you see
!   C             G         C       D7     G
   it is no surprise now what you see is me.
2. Big and black the clouds may be time will pass away
   if you put your trust in me I'll make bright your day
   look into these eyes now tell me what you see
   don't you realize now what you see is me.

3. Listen to me one more time how can I get through
   can't you try to see that I'm trying to get to you
   open up your eyes now tell me what you see
   it is no surprise now what you see is me.
