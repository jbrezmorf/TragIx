!                  Ami
1. Though you've gone away this morning
!              C            G
   you'll be back again tonight
!            Ami
   telling me there'll be no next time
!         C                    G
   if I just don't treat you right.
!            Hmi                               D
R1: You'll never leave me and you know it's true
!                G           C              D
    'cause you like me too much and I like you.
2. You've tried before to leave me
   but you haven't got the nerve
   to walk out and make me lonely
   which is all that I deserve.

*: I really do and it's nice when you believe me if you leave me.
3. I will follow you
   and bring you back where you belong
   'cause I could't really stand it
   I'd admit that I was wrong.
R2: I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
    [: 'cause you like me too much and I like you. :]
