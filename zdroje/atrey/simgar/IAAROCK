1. A winter's day in a deep and dark December
!   Dmi G7 F C  Dmi7            Emi7
   I am alone gazzing from my window
!    Dmi7           Emi7
   to the streets below
!          Dmi           F                 G
   on a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
!   F       C    F       G7 C   Ami (Ami, Ami, Ami, C)
R: I am a rock I am an island.
2. I've built walls a fortress deep and mighty
   that's none may penetrate I have no need of friendship,
   friendship causes pain
   it's laughter and it's loving I disdain.
R:
3. Don't talk of love but I've heard the word before
   it's sleeping in my memory I won't disturb the slumber
   of feelings that have died
   if I never loved I never would have cried.
R:
4. I have my books and my poetry to protect me
   I am shielded in my armour hidding in my room
   safe within my womb
   I touch no one and no one touches me.

R: + and a rock feels no pain
!            Dmi7    G7     C
     and an island never cries ...
