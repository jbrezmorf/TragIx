1. Slow down you move too fast
!   D           A        Hmi7sus A
   you got to make the morning last
!         D       A        Hmi7sus A
   just kickin' down the cobble stones
!    D           A       Hmi7sus  A
   looking for fun and Feelin' Groovy
!             D     A     Hmi7sus  A
   pa da da da da da da Feelin' Groovy.
2. Hello lamppost whatcha knowin'
   I've come to watch your flowers growin'
   ain'tcha got no rhymes for me
   doot-in-doo-doo Feelin' Groovy
   pa da da da da da da Feelin' Groovy.
3. Got no deeds to do no promises to keep
   I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
   let the morning time drop all its petals on me
   life I love you all is groovy
   pa da da da da da da ...
