2. Hide it in a hiding-place where no one ever goes
   put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
   it's a little secret just the Robinson's affair

3. Sittting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
   going to the candidates' debate
   laugh about it shout about it when you've got to choose
   ev'ry way you look at it you lose.

   "Joltin' Joe" has left and gone away hey hey hey hey hey hey.
