1. Oh Stewball was a racehorse
!          Emi          Ami
   and I wish he were mine
!                   D
   he never drank water
!                    G  C D
   he always drank wine.
2. His bridle was silver
   his main it was gold
   and the worth of his saddle
   has never been told.
3. Oh the fairgrounds were crowded
   and Stewball was there
   but the betting was heavy
   on the bay and the mare.
4. And a-way up yonder
   ahead of them all
   came a-prancin' and a-dancin'
   my noble Stewball.
5. I bet on the grey mare
   I bet on the bay
   if I'd have bet on ol' Stewball
   I'd be a free man today.
6. Oh the hoot owl she hollers
   and the turtle dove moans
   I'm a poor boy in trouble
   I'm a long way from home.
7.=1.
