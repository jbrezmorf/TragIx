!         Ami             G             F                Ami
1. When first I came to Louisville my fortune there to find
!                       G                F                Ami
   I met a fair young maiden there her beauty filled my mind
!                       G              F                Ami
   her rosy cheek her ruby lips they gave my heart no rest
!                             G      F           Ami
   the name she bore was Flora the lily of the west.
2. I courted lovely Flora she promised ne'er to go
   but soon a tale was told to me that filled my heart with woe
   they said she meets another man who holds my love in jest
   and yet I trusted Flora the lily of the west.
3. 'Way down in yonder shady grove a man of low degree
   he spoke unto my Flora there and kissed her 'neath a tree
   the answers that she gave to him like arrows pierced my breast
   I was betrayed by Flora the lily of the west.
4. I stepped up to my rival my dagger in my hand
   I seized him by the collar and I ordered him to stand
   all in my desperation I stabbed him in his breast
   I'd killed a man for Flora the lily of the west.
5. And then I had to stand my trial I had to make my plea
   they placed me in a pris'ner's dock and then commended on me
   although she swore my life away deprived me of my rest
   still I love my faithless Flora the lily of the west.
