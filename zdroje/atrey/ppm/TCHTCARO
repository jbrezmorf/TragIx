   [: he married Virgin Mary the Queen of Galilee. :]
2. And day as they were walking all in the garden green
   [: there were berries and cherries as thick as may be seen. :]
3. Then Mary said to Joseph so meek and so mild:
   [: "Joseph gather me some cherries for I am with child." :]
4. The Joseph flew in anger in anger flew he:
   [: "Let the father of the baby gather cherries for thee." :]
5. Then up spoke baby Jesus from out Mary's womb:
   [: "Bow down ye tallest tree that my mother might have some." :]
6. So bent down the tallest tree to touch Mary's hand
   [: said she: "Oh look now Joseph I have cherries at command." :]
