1. It ain't no use to sit and wonder why babe
!   F                   G
   it don't matter anyhow
!          C                C/H             Ami
   and it ain't no use to sit and wonder why babe
!   D7/F#                 G
   if you don't know by now
!             C                     C7
   when the rooster crows at the break of dawn
!    F                       D7/F#
   look out your window and I'll be gone
!   C           C/H         Ami      F
   you're the reason I'm travellin' on
!    C            G             C   G
   don't think twice it's all right.
2. It ain't no use in turnin' on your light babe
   a light I never knowed
   it ain't no use in turnin' on your light babe
   I'm on the dark side of the road
   still I wish there were something you would do or say
   to try and make me change my mind and stay
   we never did too much talkin' anyway
   so don't think twice it's all right.
3. I'm walkin' down that long lonesome road babe
   where I'm bound I can't tell
   goodbye is too good a word gal
   so I'll just say fare-thee-well
   I'm not sayin' you treated me unkind
   you could have done better but I don't mind
   you just kinda wasted my precious time
   but don't think twice it's all right.
4. It ain't no use in callin' out my name gal
   like you never done before
   it ain't no use in callin' out my name gal
   I can't hear you anymore
   I'm a-thinkin' and a-wonderin' all the way down the road
   I once loved a woman a child I am told
   I'd give her my heart but she wanted my soul
   so don't think twice it's all right.
