!     G7                            C
1. That's what you get for lovin' me
!     G7                            Ami G
   that's what you get for lovin' me
!   C                      Ami             D7 D7/C
   everything you had is gone as you can see
!     G7                            C
   that's what you get for lovin' me.
2. I ain't the kind to hang around
   with any new love that I've found
   movin' is my stock in trade I'm movin' on
   I won't think of you when I'm gone.
3. So don't you shed a tear for me
   I ain't the love you thought I'd be
   I got a hundred more like you so don't be blue
   I'll have a thousand 'fore I'm through.
4.=1.
