   but hey it feels so groovy to say:
2. I dig the Mamas and the Papas
   at The Trip Sunset Strip in L.A.
   and they got a good thing goin'
   when the words don't get in the way
   and when they're really wailing
   Michelle and Cass are sailin'
   hey they really nail me to the wall.
3. I dig Donovan
   in a dream-like tripped out way
   his crystal images
   tell you 'bout a brighter day
   and when the Beatles tell you
   they've got a word "love" to sell you
   they mean exactly what they say.
4. I dig Rock and Roll music
   I could really get it on in that scene
   I think I could say somethin'
   if you know what I mean
   but if I really say it,
   the radio won't play it
   unless I lay it between the lines!
5. Pah pah ...
