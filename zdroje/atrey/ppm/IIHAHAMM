1. If I had a hammer    I'd a hammer in the morning
!   C      D            G      Hmi C              D
   I'd a hammer in the evening    all over this land
!                   G                         Emi
   I'd hammer out danger I'd hammer out the warning
!                   C       G         C               G
   I'd hammer out love between the brothers and the sisters
!   C G D              G  Hmi C D G Hmi
   oh  all over this land.
2. If I had a bell I'd ring it in the morning
   I'd ring it in the evening all over this land
   I'd ring out danger I'd ring out the warning
   I'd ring out love between the brothers and the sisters
   oh all over this land.
3. If I had a song I'd sing it in the morning
   I'd sing it in the evening all over this land
   I'd sing out danger I'd sing out the warning
   I'd sing out love between the brothers and the sisters
   oh all over this land.
1. Well I got a hammer and I got a bell
   and I got a song to sing all over this land
   [: it's a hammer of justice it's a bell of freedom
      it's a song about love between the brothers and the sisters
!                        (G Ami G)
      oh all over this land. :]
