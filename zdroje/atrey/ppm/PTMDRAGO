2. Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail
   Jackie kept a look-out perched
   on Puff's gigantic tail
   noble kings and princes would bow whene'er they came
   pirate ships would low'r their flag
   when Puff roared out his name oh!

3. A dragon lives forever but not so little boys
   painted wings and giant rings
   make way for other toys
   one grey night it happened Jackie Paper came no more
   and Puff that mighty dragon
   he ceased his fearless roar oh!
R:
4. His head was bent in sorrow green scales fell like rain
   Puff no longer went to play
   along the cherry lane
   without his life-long friend Puff could not be brave
   so Puff that mighty dragon
   sadly slipped into his cave oh!
