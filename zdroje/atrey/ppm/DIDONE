   I know you're frightened like everyone
!   Ami                       Dmi
   is it the thunder in the distance you fear

2. Do you ask why I'm sighing my son
   you shall inherit what mankind has done
   in a world filled with sorrow and woe
   if you ask me why this is so I really don't know.
R:
3. Tell me why you're smiling my son
   is there a secret you can tell everyone
   do you know more than men that are wise
   can you see what we all must disguise through your loving eyes?
R:
