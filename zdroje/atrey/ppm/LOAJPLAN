1. All my bags are packed I'm ready to go
!         D               G
   I'm standing here outside your door
!      D               Hmi             A
   I hate to wake you up to say good-bye
!            D                    G
   but the dawn is breaking it's early morn'
!        D                    G
   the taxi's waiting he's blowin' his horn
!      D            Hmi               A
   already I'm so lonesome I could cry.
!       D            G
R: So kiss me and smile for me
!    D                G
   tell me that you wait for me
!    D                   Hmi          A
   hold me like you'll never let me go
!        D      G
   I'm leavin' on a jet plane
!   D                 G
   I don't know when I'll be back again
!   D   F#mi           A
   oh babe I hate to go.
2. There's so many times I've let you down
   so many times I've played around
   I tell you now that they don't mean a thing
   ev'ry place I go I'll think of you
   ev'ry song I sing I'll sing for you
   when I come back I'll bring your wedding ring.
R:
3. Now the time has come I'm leavin' you
   just one more time let me kiss you
   then close your eyes and I'll be on my way
   you can dream about the days to come
   when I won't have to leave alone
   about the times when I won't have to say.
R:
