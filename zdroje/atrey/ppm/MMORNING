!   Dmi                    E            Ami
1. Early one mornin' one mornin' in spring
!       Dmi             G          C            E
   to hear the birds whistle the nightingales sing
!      Ami        G           Ami        Emi7
   I met a fair maiden who sweetly did sing
!        Ami         Dmi          E         Ami
   I'm going to be married next Monday morning.
2. How old are you my fair young maid
   here in this valley this valley so green
   how old are you my fair young maid
   I'm goin' to be sixteen next Monday mornin'.
3. Well sixteen years old that's too young for to marry
   so take my advice five years longer to tarry
   for marriage brings troubles and sorrows begin
   so put off your wedding for Monday mornin'.
4. You talk like a mad man a man with no skill
   two years I've been waiting against my own will
   now I'm determined to have my own way
   and I'm going to be married next Monday mornin'.
5. Next Monday mornin' the bells they will ring
   my true love will buy me a gay gold ring
   also he'll buy me a new pretty gown
   to wear at my wedding next Monday mornin'.
6. Next Monday night when I go to my bed
   and I turn round to the man that I've wed
   around his middle my two arms I will fling
   and I wish to my soul it was Monday mornin'.
