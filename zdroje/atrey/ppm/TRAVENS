   as great with young as she might go
   with a down derry derry derry down down.
3. She lifted up his bloody head
   down-a-down hey down-a-down
   and kissed his wounds that were so red with a down
   she got him up across her back
   and carried him to the earthen lack
   with a down derry derry derry down down.
4. She buried him before his prime

   she was dead herself ere evening time with a down
   God send every gentlemen
   fine hawks fine hounds and such a loved one
   with a down derry derry derry down hm.
