1. Truth with all it's far out schemes
!          D
   let's time decide what it should mean
!         G
   it's not the time but just the dreams that die
   and sometimes when the room is still
!    Hmi
   time with so much truth to kill
!    C                                 G
   leaves you by the window still so tied
!              Ami D            G
   without a wing to take you high
!               Ami D             G
   without a clue  to tell you why.
2. Now I just want to keep my name
   not bother anybody's game
   without ideas of gold or fame or insane heights
   I don't want a lot of money
   I don't want a Playboy Bunny
   just a love to call me honey late at night
   in my arms by my side
   in my arms late at night.
!       D              C           D
R: But I don't know I ain't been told
!                      C       D
   ev'rybody wants a hand to hold
!                         C    D
   they're so afraid of being old
!                       C     D
   so scared of dying so unknown
!            Ami          C  G D C D
   and so alone rollin' home.
3. Well I see the ones who crawl like moles
   who for a front would trade their souls,
   a broken mirror's the only hole for them
   and for you who'd exchange yourselves
   just to be somebody else,
   pretending things you never felt or meant
   hey you don't live what you defend
   you can't give so you just bend.
4. Now if you care what people think
   like they supplied some missing link
   they'll just stand back and watch you sink so slow
   they'll never help you to decide
   they'll only take you for a ride
   after which they'll try and hide the fact that they don't know
   what you should do where you should go
   what you should do where you should go.
R:
5. There's nothing big I want to prove
   no mountains that I need to move
   or even claim what's right or true for you
   my sights my songs are slightly charred
   you might think they miss their mark
   but things are only what they are and nothing new
   but for me I think they'll do
   but for me I think they'll do.
6. Well I can see a king and queen
   a beggar falling at my feet
   they all must see the same sad dreams at night
   futility and senseless war
   pit the rich against the poor
   while cause is buried long before the fight
   for what was wrong for what was right
   it's just the strong who ever says what's right.
