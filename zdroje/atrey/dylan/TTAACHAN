1. Come gather round people wherever you roam
!                       C       D
   and admit that the waters around you have grown
!          G            Emi             C              G
   and accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
!                    Ami          D
   if your time to you is worth saving
!                             C                 G            D
   then you'd better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
!            G                 D  G
   for the times they are a-changing.
2. Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pens
   and keep your eyes wide the chance won't come again
   and don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
   and there's no telling who that it's naming
   but the loser now will be later to win
   for the times they are a-changing.
3. Come senators congressmen please heed the call
   don't stand in the doorway don't block up the hall
   for he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
   the battle outside ragging
   will soon shake your windows and rattle your halls
   for the times they are a-changing.
4. Come mothers and fathers all over this land
   and don't criticize what you can't understand
   your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
   your old role is rapidly aging
   please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
   for the times they are a-changing.
5. The line it is drawn the curse it is cast
   the slow one now will later be fast
   and the present now will later be past
   the order is rapidly fading
   and the first one now will later be last
   for the times they are a-changing.
