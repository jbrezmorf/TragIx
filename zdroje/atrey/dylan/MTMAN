R: Hey Mister Tambourine Man play a song for me
!             G              C                D
   I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
!    C          D               G              C
   hey Mister Tambourine Man play a song for me
!           G             C                 D         G
   in the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.

1. Though I know that evening's empire
!        G             C
   has returned into sand
!    G                C
   vanished from my hand
!             G               C
   left me blindly here to stand
!                   D
   but still not sleepin'
!       C          D
   my weariness amazes me
!         G            C
   I'm branded on my feet
!      G              C
   I have no one to meet
!          G                C
   and my ancient empty street's
!                  D
   too dead for dreamin'.

2. Take me on a trip
   upon your magic swirling ship
   my senses have been stripped
   my hands can't feel to grip
   my toes to numb to step
   wait only for my bootheels
   to be wanderin'
   I'm ready to go anywhere
   I'm ready for to fade
   into my own parade
   cast your dancing spell my way
   I promise to go under it.
R:
3. Though you might hear laughing spinning swinging
   madly across the sun
   its not aimed at anyone
   its just escaping on the run
   and but for the sky there
   are no fences facin'
   and if you hear vague traces
   of skipping reels of rhyme
   to your tambourine in time
   its just a ragged clown behind
   I wouldn't pay it any mind
   its just a shadow you're seeing
   that he's chasing.
R:
4. Then take me dissappearing
   through the smoke rings of my mind
   down the foggy ruins of time
   far past the frozen leaves
   the haunted frightened trees
   out to the windy beach
   far from the twisted reach
   of crazy sorrow
   yes to dance beneath the diamond sky
   with one hand waving free
   silhouetted by the sea
   circled by the circus sands
   with all memory and fate
   driven deep beneath the waves
   let me forget about today
   until tomorrow.
