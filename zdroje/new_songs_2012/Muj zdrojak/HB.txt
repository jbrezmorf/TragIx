I don't need to climb a high mountain
Seeking the truth and way to you.
You are so wonderful, Creator, Holy one.
You're the only one that I adore.

I do want to walk with you Father
Asking your guidance every day.
And when I stumble down you lift me up again!
You're the only one that I adore.

The cross was the way and it says you'll be with me... day after day.
I heard you calling and felt that I had to seek You!
And I finally realized, that your ways are (D)so much (C)hig(D)her than (C)mine.
You know everything. Your (D)wisdom and power exceeds all limits

(Am)He came to save us. (D)He gave his (Hm)life for us!
God has all Glory, Power and Honour!
He concurred death and brought us salvation.

2: You forgave all the things that were sin against you.
It was so outstanding -- my dark heart is so clean -- You love me so!
Now I want to serve you. Whatever you want, I will do.
You have all the Power that's why I can trust in You. Jesus, my lord!
My life belongs to you, You promised to lead me and never leave me.

Do you walk past with no thought, about those who have no hope?

Why is it hard to see, all you need is to believe.
Do you think that it's enough, just to have faith, then shut up.

The Lord is your shepherd, why do you worry?
Kneel down before him. You need His love again!

(Am)Can any (Edim)help be (H)found?

R: (Em)Years (D)just (Hm)go (C)by. Old (Am)memories of home fade (Em)off.

2: Once there was a cheerless time. A little girl looked at the world with a tear.
Her only friend was an old doll, for she did not have a mother to love her.
As time goes by and children grow,
old tears are lost, new ones take their empty space.
The girl has left this world and there's no one to recall and miss her.

Who are we trying to impress. You are the one who deserves all praise.
Because of your Son, the Righteous One

2: Once I saw a Lady full of grace,
Thought tired still preaching the word.
She cried out and wept when she told us
That God really loves us all.
“Not everyone will go to Heaven,
Some will face the wrath of God.”
At last people realized that they must
Decide on whoms side they are.

Many were forgiven, they were born again.
Jesus was uplifted, the rest faded away.

And a faith without deeds makes
Land dry, land die.

What wisdom I have in my eyes
As I give up His truth for lies
How could man outwit his own creator?
Learn by what you see
A Father will correct those who are his dearest
So that one day I might
Enter His grand kingdom up on high
There I will know how to praise Him for burdening me.

Maybe I need to be tested so that
I will be set for the time when He comes
Then Jesus takes his victorious place
It has come to pass
The word of God will be filled.


3. It Is Time 2

Em F" G

Many nights I can find no rest
As my conscience puts me on test
It is certain: if your hands are dirty
You cannot live in peace
You can let go for just one day
Gaining debt you’ll one have to pay
All the world has fallen for the same illusion and
Crying while it’s suffering.

If you are the almighty God,
Why let evilness reign
Smiting men and fighting faith while
You could have stopped this.

It’s time to chose my side, live as I am
Taking tiny steps in the wrong and
Saying what I know I have said before:
I’ll turn back, just not today
The other option: deep from my heart I can find you
Where I left you, God of my childhood
Jesus still has hope for the hopeless,
He can make me fearless and free.
Amen

It’s a tough school to start and see
What I guess he has always seen
Though I thought I was the wisest one
But my sin had blinded me
I was seeking truth from the skies,
Every mountain, every peak up high
Till I found him
In the depth of my pit
Jesus in his mercy

Should the Lord remove all evil,
I’d be first in the line
He would have to wipe out us and all of the people.

That is why the almighty God lets evilness reign
Smiting men and fighting faith wile
You could have stopped this
You could have stopped this

5. Nightmare

There’s no way to hide, as my very mind is
Invaded by an army, there’s no help to find
It holds me so tight
So how to survive in this fight.

God he owns my life
Dear Jesus Christ I know it well yet it is hard
The enemy knows how to recall
And In my past I am his slave.

I think I just served today the prince of darkness
I was much more faithful than I’ve been in ages
How could any faithful one
Do the things that you have done
Straight to hell, straight to hell,
You are surely heading straight to hell.

Step away Satan
For I know your every lie by heart
I’m aware of your power as you
Blame me for what’s done
I’m a sinner from birth, and so what?
Hell is my due fee
Yet in Jesus there’s sanctuary
And that’s where I may be

In this dying corpse with many faults
Deeply in love with myself
I’m not of this world yet in the world
And in worldly ways I’m living

My spirit bears fruit rotten to root
Even the swine won’t eat them
Such pathetic being, hypocrite being,
Unholy being..
(Born unholy, Die unholy!)

Please forgive me Jesus Christ
I did not understand
Jealous and a thief am I how can I mend it?
You are my possession now
To me you shall always bow.
With me eternally, you cannot break free.


6. Holy Bible

How can we guard our faith in the loving Lord
There is too many people who have not opened the Holy Word
So we stumble, fall down, losing Him and all control
And our souls, they fade, soon our love is cold as stone
Here are the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
There you read what Jesus did and how He made a lame man walk
How He conquered the universe and made the world as one
And the Father God sent His Son to show His love

[Chorus]
There are four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John
Book of Acts, Romans, Chorinthians, and Galations,
Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Thessalonians,
Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Hebrews, and James
Two Peters´and three Johns' Jude and John´s Revalation

Here is a Pharasee an angry man from Tarsus
And later on it is known that he´s called Apostle Saul
He suffered very much and went through so many trials
And his letters tell how we should live worthwhile lives

[Chorus]
There are four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John
Book of Acts, Romans, Chorinthians, and Galations,
Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Thessalonians,
Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Hebrews, and James
Two Peters´and three Johns' Jude and John´s Revalation

There is in store for us an old testament:
The creation, bloodlines, rules, poems, and prophets
All those children of man walking with the God of Word
Reading through these books you will learn to trust the Lord
Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus,
Numbers, Deuteronamy, Joshua, Judges, and Ruth
Samuels, Kings, Chronicles, Ezra and Nehamiah
Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastis, Songs (of Solomon),
Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel,
Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah,
Nahum, Habukuk, Zephaniah, Haggai,
Zechariah, Malachi, and in the new:

[Chorus]
There are four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John
Book of Acts, Romans, Chorinthians, and Galations,
Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Thessalonians,
Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Hebrews, and James
Two Peters´and three Johns' Jude and John´s Revalation

There´s pride in knowing all sorts of tiny facts:
All my brothers seem to master many complicated knacks
So I will learn by heart what in Matthew, I can find:
There´s a bloodline from Abraham to Jesus Christ
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, and Perez,
Hezron and Ram, Amminadab and Nahshom,
Salmon, Boaz, Obed, Jesse and David the king,
Solomon, Rehaboam, Abijah, Asa,
Jehoshaphat, Joram, Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, Manasseh, Amon,
Josiah, Jechoniah, Shealtiel,
Zerubbabel, Abiud, Eliakim, Azor, Sadoc, Achim, Eliud, Eleazar,
Matthan, Jacob, Joseph,
Jesus, the Christ, God´s only begotten Son

I (Gm)can't rip the (Gm7)shackles (A)off me
Jesus (Gm)would you take me home now
I have (Edim)no more strength to care
I (Gm)can not and i will not
I (Edim)leave all this behind me
(Gm)There is no (Gm7)way re(A)turning
(Gm)There is no (Gm7)God left (A)for me

You made me empty, guess to fill me,
but sin was able to survive
I lost my faith, in strength that is found in repentance
allthough i wish to find your face
I guess this world needs someone wretched,
reminder to blessed ones
the wish of our creator was to cease my failure
and to cure this twisted nature

Where's the strength to go on?
I have no friend to comfort my soul
Tell me what kind of a hero,
stumbles on the smallest rock,
dies on the way to battlefield
ends up a laughing stock,
achieving nearly evil
Maybe i was duely judgefull
mugging God's own Holy Ghost
this mighty warrior of the lord,
shall in flames of hell be lost,
where there is no way returning,
there is no God left for me


8. King's Design

kapo 2

If I told (Am)you that you(A2)'re truly (Am)loved
How'd it (A4)make you (Am)feel, my (A2)one? (Am)
'fore your (A4)birth I (Am)knew you
If I told you that you are unique in me
I designed your very being
You're the only one who's (Dm)you(D2)
(Dm)I made you for a (Am)reason(A2 Am A4)

(Am)(A2 Am A4)
Oh, Lord, look at me
That you love me doesn't matter
When no one even sees that I am here

(G)Do not consider your(Dm)self so futile!

(Am)(A2 Am A4)
You're a hundert percent King's design
A model made in Heaven
Always top rate, no mistakes
But sin makes life so deeply (G)burden(C)some
(Dm)I know what people can be
They de(Am)value and despise all life
(Dm)Can't you trust in (C)me(B)?

I just wish I could be loved by someone
My pleadings are uncomplicated, you see

Trust me, I am working all things out just for your good

[spoken Isaiah 43:1b]
"Fear not, for i have redeemed you; i have summoned you by name; you are mine"

Untalented is my name
I am never smart enough
Plain and boring kind of guy
Not a social butterfly
I'm so tired of being the odd one out
And even you seem so very far away, can't you see?

You cannot see things the way that I do

You're a hundert percent King's design
A model made in Heaven
Always top rate, no mistakes
But sin makes life so deeply burdensome
I know what people can be
They devalue and despise all life
Can't you trust in me?
Trust in me for I trust in you


9. Joy Upon The Lord

Frost has fallen again
Non-stop endless rain
Darts of coal black ice
Loads too heavy to bear
They press me hard to the ground
I have no strength to rise

Fire took all my fortune
So humbled by my falling down
Fire came, making me
A sinner of a man

I know that joy upon the Lord
Is where our strength will rise
Even the low, the weak one
Finds the Lord gives help, advise
There's one who helps the weakest child
Jesus the mighty God
So fix your trust upon our Saviour

Safe in your warmth again
Non-stop endless rain
A sweet scent of blessings
Loads have vanished away
All of my gratefulness
I lay in Jesus' hands

Fire brought all god's fortune
Lifted me higher than my reach
Fire came, took away
The sinner of a man

I know that joy upon the Lord
Is where our strength will rise
Even the low, the weak one
Finds the Lord gives help, advise
There's one who helps the weakest child
Jesus the mighty God
So fix your trust upon our Saviour

Fire takes and fire brings
Unto the mercy seat of God
Fire makes, fire takes
The sinner of a man


10. The Lord Of Lords

Mundane thoughts calm down
The presence of His holiness
Makes solemn seems so right
Both elderly and young
Are reaching up towards the sky
To feel Him passing by

There are no words, there are no songs
The silence grows, we want to hear His voice

He is the Lord of lords
Yet he calls each one of us by name
He made us for Heaven
To be loved as sons and daughters
It's all that truly matters
He wants to fill our hearts again
And give eternal life

He is the Lord of lords
He has all the nations in his hands
Yet he reaches out for you
When you thought no one was listening
He heard what you were whispering
He's here to meet you face to face
And give His warm embrace

Heavens gather down
As angels rush to testify
The greatest sight in creation
When God Almighty meets a man
Even the dried out bones arise
And stand tall for His glory

There are no words, there are no songs
The silence grows, we want to hear His voice

He is the Lord of lords
Yet he calls each one of us by name
He made us for Heaven
To be loved as sons and daughters
It's all that truly matters
He wants to fill our hearts again
And give eternal life

He is the Lord of lords
He has all the nations in his hands
Yet he reaches out for you
When you thought no one was listening
He heard what you were whispering
He's here to meet you face to face
And give His warm embrace

3. The Battle Of God

/* sloky jsou v originale jen Em az na konec prvni casti */

(Em)Who will take the blame or
(C)who will pay the price for
(D)teaching what is false
in the (Em)sight of God (Bm D)

(Em)You can be a leader
(C)preaching of a heathen
(D)God without the dull side
of (Em)judging us

Don't let the devil rest
do the things you do best
make sure that God
will be glorified

Such things will in you grow
no one can overthrow
ask that in God
you'd be satisfied

The (C)battle of God
needs the (Em)strongest of hands
The (C)bravest is he who
de(Em)clares where he (D)stands
So (C)come all ye faithful,
you (Em)heroes of God
(C)Die to the (D)world,
be a(Em)live in Christ

Who will take the blame or
take the money raised for
those who do not have daily
bread today

Heaven is for sale in
this life but in the next those
first will be the last like
the Gospels say

You don't bother to resist
temptation, any beast
mercy will cover
all things you've done

Your tree will not carry fruit
it's dying at the root
while there are plenty
of things to do

The battle of God
needs the strongest of hands
The bravest is he who
declares where he stands
So come all ye faithful,
you heroes of God
Die to the world,

You cannot make it without God

Turn to Him in all your want

He forgives you everything

Gives a brand new beginning

The battle of God
needs the strongest of hands
The bravest is he who
declares where he stands
So come all ye faithful,
you heroes of God
Die to the world,
be alive in Christ


4. Love Me

(Dm G" B)

Am Dm

(Am)No, Heaven is (Dm)not for me.
I cannot give you praise
with tongues I (Am)cannot (Dm)speak.
No, there are hardly dreams for me.
No visions come to me,
no wisdom I could teach

I would prove you
I am your own.
I would fill that
place you gave me.

Don't you love me no more?
I'm afraid I failed.
Would you hold me, my lord?
For days and nights I prayed.
Please God, hear me.

No, Heaven is not for me.
Can't lift your fame up for
my hands are far too weak.
No, there are hardly dreams for me.
Nothing I do shows your
power to those who seek.

I would prove you
I am your own.
I would fill that
place you gave me.

Don't you love me no more?
I'm afraid I failed.
Would you hold me, my lord?
For days and nights I prayed.
Please God, hear me.

Don't you love me?
Don't you no more?
I'm so afraid I failed.
Would you hold me, my Lord?
For days and nights I prayed.

Don't you love me no more? x4
Don't you love me, my Lord? x4
Don't you love me, don't you love me, Lord?
